####################################  FLAPPY BIRD GAME  #####################################

I build a flappy bird game using python and OpenCv. I used python pygame module to build a flappy bird game.There are two python files in my Flappy Bird game folder.   One is Project_Flappy_Bird_game.py and second is CV2_FlappyBird.py
In CV2_FlappyBird game I used some ComputerVision functionality and build an amazing flappybird game that detects object color and bird will follow that object and move accordingly. 

***HOW TO RUN FILES?

##  Prerequest:-
->make sure that you have downloaded following library/module:- random, sys , pygame , cv2 , numpy.
-->Project_Flappy_Bird_game.py
STEP 1 : create a new folder in your machine and store all the files and folders in that new folder.
STEP 2 : now open that new folder in any code editor recommended VSCode.
STEP 3 : now open project Flappybird.py file and run it.(make sure that all the steps are followed properly)

####################################  FLAPPY BIRD GAME WITH CV2 #####################################

-->CV2_FlappyBird.py
STEP 1 : create a new folder in your machine and store all the files and folders in that new folder.
STEP 2 : now open that new folder in any code editor recommended VSCode.
STEP 3 : now open CV2_FlappyBird.py and run it.
STEP 4 : After running file it will start your macine webcam and detect pink color(you can change color by changing color values) object if it didn't find then it            will close automatically.

***Demo video of CV2_flappyBird is available on my LinkedIn. "www.linkedin.com/in/shyam1320"***

##################################### Virtual Paint ###########################################

I build a virtual paint using python and computer vision. After running program will start our computer webcam and It will detects object color and we can paint/write using that object's color.

***HOW TO RUN FILES?

##  Prerequest:-
->make sure that you have downloaded following library/module:- matplotlib , cv2 , numpy.

-->virtual_paint_cv2.py
STEP 1 : open virtual_paint_cv2.py and run it in VScode.
STEP 2 : After running file it will start your macine webcam and detect objects color and start your work.

###################################### dino_auto ###############################################

I automate the google dino game. I set one small box on dino running path when the color of that box pixecels are changed at that time our dino. will jump and it runs in loop.

##  Prerequest:-
->make sure that you have downloaded following library/module:- pyautogui, time , numpy.

-->dino_auto.py
STEP 1 : now open dino_auto.py and run it in VScode.
STEP 2 : Before running file split your screen into 2 parts left side chrome-dino game and right side your code editor and just run your program and start game.

NOTE:::***You need to change height and width accourding to your screen size.currently values are set for 14 inch monitor screen size. if your screen size is different then you have to change the height and width value else it will not work properly.***(for help contact me on LinkedIn: "www.linkedin.com/in/shyam1320" )

###################################### voice_to_handwritten_text #################################

I made students assignment work easy :) It simply take our voice as an input and our program will convert our voice data to handwritten-text and it will store in given location as .jpg file.

##  Prerequest:-
->make sure that you have downloaded following library/module:- pywhatkit , speech_recognition .

-->voice_to_handwritten_text.py
STEP 1 : now open voice_to_handwritten_text.py and run it in VScode.
STEP 2 : Speak whatever you want to print and your speech will convert to handwritten text.

####################################  Detecting and classifying vehicle  #####################################

In this project, I am Worked on a deep learning algorithm with Computer Vision that detects cars and some car details, with using that I classified that car type
like if car is having yellow license-plate, ola/uber/taxi marks on body then it classified as a commercial vehicle, if car having green number-plate and signs like 
EV on the car body then classified it as a electric vehicle else it is normal vehicle.

##   Prerequests:-

make sure that you have downloaded following library/module:- glob, os, re(Regular Expresion), cv2, numpy, yolo(darknet file)

-->main.ipynb
STEP 1 : there is trained model file link is available in My_Projects/Detecting and classifying/readme.txt 
STEP 2 : Install all the requirements and library in colab
STEP 3 : Simply pass image or video file of vehicles and you will get the output
STEP 4 : For running a model check My_Projects/Detecting and classifying/main.ipynb file for code.
