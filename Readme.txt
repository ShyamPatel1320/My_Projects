####################################  FLAPPY BIRD GAME  #####################################

I build a flappy bird game using python and OpenCv. I used python pygame module to build a flappy bird game.There are two python files in my Flappy Bird game folder.   One is Project_Flappy_Bird_game.py and second is CV2_FlappyBird.py
In CV2_FlappyBird game I used some ComputerVision functionality and build an amazing flappybird game that detects object color and bird will follow that object and move accordingly. 
HOW TO RUN FILES?
-->Project_Flappy_Bird_game.py
STEP 1 : create a new folder in your machine and store all the files and folders in that new folder.
STEP 2 : now open that new folder in any code editor recommended VSCode.
STEP 3 : now open project Flappybird.py file and run it.(make sure that all the steps are followed properly)

-->CV2_FlappyBird.py
STEP 1 : create a new folder in your machine and store all the files and folders in that new folder.
STEP 2 : now open that new folder in any code editor recommended VSCode.
STEP 3 : now open CV2_FlappyBird.py and run it.
STEP 4 : After running file it will open your macine webcam and detect pink color(you can change color by changing color values) object if it didn't find then it will          close automatically.
